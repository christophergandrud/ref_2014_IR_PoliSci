# REF IR/Political Science Prediction Models (version 0.2)
Christopher Gandrud  
23 February 2016  



I conducted a simple Random Forest Regression to examine how IR/Political Science REF 2014 Output GPAs could be predicted using:

- **Mean Impact Factor** for all of the journal article submissions that each university made. Note: if a journal was not assigned an impact factor[^impact_caveat] it is effectively given an impact factor of 0.

- **Percent** of article submissions from journals in the **top 20** IR or Political Science categories assembled by Google Scholar.

Both of these metrics are highly correlated with REF Output GPAs. Mean impact factor has a correlation coefficient of 0.68 with REF Output GPAs and the REF GPA correlation the Google Scholar metric is 0.76. The following figure further illustrates these close relationships and City University's placement within them. 

It is important to note that neither of these metrics contain information on books and other non-journal materials which are also submitted to the REF.

# More Complex Model: Google Scholar + Impact Factor

To examine how well these journal metrics could predict REF Output GPAs I first ran the random forest regression model on a random sample of 70% of the 56 universities (i.e. 38) that made REF submissions for IR/Political Science. I then used the estimates from the model to predict the REF Output scores of the remaining 30% (i.e. 17 universities). The following figure compares the actual REF GPA scores to the predictions. Note: if the model perfectly predicted the GPA score then each dot would lie one the 45 degree line. The mean prediction error when using the two journal metrics was only 0.05. In other words, on average the model incorrectly predicted the REF GPA score by 0.05 GPA points or only 1.2% of the GPA scale.

# Simpler model: Google Scholar-only



The percentage of journal submissions in the top Google Scholar lists is more strongly correlated with REF GPA scores than impact factors. Would a simpler model using just the Google Scholar metric perform just as well as the more complex two metric model? The following figures shows actual vs. predicted GPA scores for this model. The mean prediction error when using only the Google Scholar metric was 0.012. In other words, on average the model incorrectly predicted the REF GPA score by 0.01 GPA points or 0.3% of the GPA scale. The Goolge Scholar-only model actually out performs the the more complex model that also included information on impact factors.

# Google Plus

The Google Top 20 IR and Political Science lists are notably lacking important political economy journals, notably *Review of International Political Economy* and *New Political Economy*. Does adding these journals to a "Google Scholar Plus" variable improve prediction performance? The following figure shows the predicted vs. actual REF GPAs for our test sample using the Google Scholar Plus variable. The mean prediction error when using only the Google Scholar Plus metric was 0.005. In other words, on average the model incorrectly predicted the REF GPA score by 0 GPA points or 0.1% of the GPA scale. The Goolge Scholar Plus model out performs both the two metric model and the Google Scholar only model.

# Top 20 (IR + PS) Google Scholar Journals (February 2016)

For reference, the following is a list of the top 20 journals in the Google Scholar IR and Political Science categories. We also include the most recent Thomson-Reuters Impact factor to enable comparison between the two metrics.

[^impact_caveat]: E.g. new journals and journals not included in the impact factor list used. Note that we attempted to match all of the sumbitted articles' journal names with those on the impact factor list. However, due to spelling  variations in the two sets of journal names, some matches may not have been made.
